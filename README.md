# CS465-Fullstack
CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN
Architecture

For our full stack project, Express HTML was used to provide server-side pages, allowing dynamic content delivery based on server logic. JavaScript added interactivity on the client side, enabling real-time updates without needing to reload the page. The Single Page Application (SPA) structure using Angular created a smoother experience by loading all resources upfront and updating content as needed. For the backend, we used MongoDB, which handles JSON-like document storage, ensuring efficient data management.

Functionality

In this project, JSON acts as the intermediary between the frontend and backend, facilitating data exchange. JSON is used to send and receive server data, allowing the frontend to update dynamically without requiring a page reload. UI components were modularized to enhance scalability and reusability across the app. This approach streamlined development, made the application more efficient, and simplified updates.

Testing

Testing involved verifying the application's endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, ensuring they functioned as expected. Additional testing was required after implementing authentication. Tools like Postman were used to ensure communication between the frontend and backend. Testing became more complex after adding security measures, as authenticated users needed proper access to specific areas of the application.

Reflection

This course was fast-paced and information-dense, offering a pivotal experience in full stack development. Hands-on work involved building a complete web application from frontend to backend. We used Angular for a SPA, implemented secure user authentication, and integrated a MongoDB database to handle dynamic data.
